# Passkey demo app

This app demonstrates a full end-to-end passkey implementation in Android, using Jetpack Credential Manager and Compose.

For the server side implementation, see https://github.com/tdcolvin/PasskeyAuthDemoServer.

It authenticates to a demo server I've set up: auth.tomcolvin.co.uk.

Please open an issue if you hit any problems. And if you need help implementing passkeys in your own app (or anything else Android-y) then I'm [available as a freelancer](https://www.tomcolvin.co.uk) üòÅ.
